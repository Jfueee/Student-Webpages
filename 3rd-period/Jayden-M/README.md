# Jayden Mai - Portfolio

## About Me

Hey there! My name is Jayden Mai. I am a 17-year-old senior at Mt Eden High School living in Hayward. I am a 3x sport athlete and will be attending Chabot College next year. I’m also considering joining the Air Force the year after. I have a passion for programming games and building fun interactive projects.

## Project Overview

This portfolio showcases my programming projects and highlights my journey as a young developer. It demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through several interactive games I have created. This project reflects my growing confidence in coding, problem-solving, and sharing my work with others.

## Portfolio Website Features

My portfolio website includes:

- A personalized homepage with my introduction  
- An “About Me” section describing my background and interests  
- A “Games I Program” section showcasing multiple game projects with descriptions and links  
- Clean, responsive design with easy navigation  
- Use of core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structure, styling, and interactivity  

## Featured Projects

Here are some games I have programmed:

- **Guess the Number**  
  A game where you try to guess a secret number with hints telling you if your guess is too high or too low.

- **Fifteen Puzzle**  
  A classic sliding puzzle that challenges your logic and speed as you arrange numbers 1–15 in order.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  The timeless X and O game to play against a friend and try to get three in a row first.

- **Click Challenge**  
  Click a button as many times as possible before time runs out. It tests your speed and timing!
